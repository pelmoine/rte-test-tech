Consigne
==================
You have to reorganize the file. The file 'test.txt' is fill by numbers. Your program must create an other file called 'result.txt' which contains at the first line all number with last digit equal 0, the seconde line all the number with last digit equal 1 ...

Each line will be separated by character '\n'.
Each number will be separated by a space.

Your work has to be industrial (Evolutive, clean, readable, tested, ...)
